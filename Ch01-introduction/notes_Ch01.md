## Chapter 1 Introduction - Notes

# 1.3 Introduction
Course primarily designed for *system administrators*.
Tasks you need/want to do: configuring, running, troubleshooting multiple machines in Enterprise environment
Want to learn how to do things properly and natively in Linux

Course **not** designed primarily for:
1. New users without much experience with *any* operating system
2. Kernel or application developers
3. Experienced administrators concentrating on performance tuning

If 1, take LFS101x - Introduction to Linux (found on edX)
If 2, may find material interesting, especially if you have more knowledge regarding:
- operating system theory
- kernel internals
- applications
The more you know about above, the more you will get from course.
If 3, will be skimmed in course, but take more advanced courses dedicated to performance tuning, such as LFS426.
