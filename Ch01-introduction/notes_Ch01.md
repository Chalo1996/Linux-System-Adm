# Chapter 1 Introduction - Notes

## 1.3 Introduction
Course primarily designed for *system administrators*.

Tasks you need/want to do: configuring, running, troubleshooting multiple machines in Enterprise environment

Want to learn how to do things properly and natively in Linux


Course **not** designed primarily for:
1. New users without much experience with *any* operating system
2. Kernel or application developers
3. Experienced administrators concentrating on performance tuning


If 1, take LFS101x - Introduction to Linux (found on [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linux))

If 2, may find material interesting, especially if you have more knowledge regarding:
- operating system theory
- kernel internals
- applications

The more you know about above, the more you will get from course.

If 3, will be skimmed in course, but take more advanced courses dedicated to performance tuning, such as LFS426.


## 1.4 Relationship to LFS101x
Assumption: You've taken [LFS101x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-linux), or have equivalent or better knowledge than gained from course.

Recommendation: sign up, or at least do a quick browse through material. It's free!

Some content areas covered in LFS101x covered in LFS201, but at greater detail. Eg. package management

Other topics necessary for system administrators, but not covered in course:
- text editors (vi, emacs, nano, gedit, etc.)
- finding Linux documentation (getting help)
- Manipulating text (sed, grep, awk, cut, paste, tail, head, etc.)
- file utilities (find, locate, file, etc.)
- printing (configuring printers, managing print jobs)
- graphical interfaces and their administration
- bach shell scripting
- system installation

Strong recommendation: at least take a look at LFS101x. If not completely familiar with some basic utilities and procedures used in LFS201, can probably find in LFS101x.

## 1.5 Course Formatting
Various types of content contained in course, and color coding and formats used to distinguish them:
- **Bold: names of programs or services (or used for emphasis)**
- Light blue: hyperlinks
- Dark blue: text typed at the command line
- Green: system output at the command line
- Brown: files names and file content

(Will come back to add actual color to text after learning more about Markdown styles)
