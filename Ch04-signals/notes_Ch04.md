# Chapter 4 Signals - Notes

## 4.2 Introduction
**Signals**: used to emit notifications for processes to take action in response to often unpredictable events. May be caused from within process itself, or external events such as other processes.

Many signals fatal, resulting in process termination. Death can sometimes be averted if program designers decide to handle (subvert) certain termination signals.

Many signals more benign, just informative or request other kinds of actions. Possible to send signals (including those that induce termination) from command line using **kill**, **killall**, **pkill**.


## 4.3 Learning Objectives:
- Explain what signals are and how they are used.
- Know the available signals and types of signals available in Linux.
- Use kill, killall, and pkill to send signals from the command line.


## 4.4 What are Signals?
Signals: one of oldest methods of **Inter-Process Communication** (**IPC**), used to notify processes about **asynchronous** events (or exceptions).
