# Chapter 22 Encrypting Disks - Notes

## 22.2 Introduction
Filesystems may be **encrypted** to protect them from both prying eyes and attempts to corrupt data they contain. Encryption can be chosen at installation, or incorporated later. Linux distributions most often use **LUKS** method, and perform encrcyption-related tasks using **cryptsetup**.

## 22.3 Learning Objectives:
- Provide sound reasons for using encryption and know when it is called for.
- Understand how **LUKS** operates through the use of **cryptsetup**.
- Set up and use encrypted filesystems and partitions.
- Configure the system to mount encrypted partitions at boot.
