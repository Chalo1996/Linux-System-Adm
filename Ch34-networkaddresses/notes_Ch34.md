# Chapter 34 Network Addresses - Notes

## 34.3 Learning Objectives:
- Differentiate between different types of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- Understand the role of netmasks.
- Get, set, and change the hostname, based on the system you are using.


## 34.4 IP Addresses
**IP addresses** used globally to uniquely identify nodes across internet. Registered through <strong>ISP</strong>s (<strong>I</strong>nternet <strong>S</strong>ervice <strong>P</strong>roviders).

IP address is the number that identifies your system on the network. Comes in two varieties:
- **IPv4**: A 32-bit address, composed of 4 **octets** (an octet is just 8 bits, or a byte)

  Example: **`148.114.252.10`**
- **IPv6**: A 128-bit address, composed of 8 16-bit octet pairs.

  Example: **`2003:0db5:6123:0000:1f4f:0000:5529:fe23`**

In either case, set of **reserved** addresses also included. Will focus somewhat more on IPv4, as it is still what is most commonly used.
