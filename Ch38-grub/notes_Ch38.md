# Chapter 38 GRUB - Notes

## 38.2 Introduction
A system that can not start up on its own is rather useless. Linux systems have a lot of flexibility in how they boot. Possible to choose between different kernel versions or options, or even different operating systems in multiple-boot scenarios. Most non-embedded systems use the Grand Unified Boot Loader to accomplish the first steps of a successful system initialization. GRUB also has interactive capabilities as well as a secure password facility.

## 38.3 Learning Objectives:
- Explain what the role of GRUB is.
- Understand the differences between the GRUB 1 and GRUB 2 versions.
- Explain the interactive selections you can make at boot.
- Install GRUB.
- Explain how the configuration files that GRUB needs are used and modified.
