# Chapter 42 Local System Security - Notes

## 42.2 Introduction
Essential task of any system administrator is to secure the system(s) against both internal and external threats. Work begins with designing proper security policy, crafted to defend against expected and unexpected threat vectors. In addition, good system hygiene has to be practiced; systems need to be maintained and upgraded in timely fashion, as well as physically protected from usurpers. Furthermore, sensible policies have to guarantee only appropriate users have potentially dangerous privileges, and only those which are absolutely needed.
