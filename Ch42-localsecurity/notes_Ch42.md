# Chapter 42 Local System Security - Notes

## 42.2 Introduction
Essential task of any system administrator is to secure the system(s) against both internal and external threats. Work begins with designing proper security policy, crafted to defend against expected and unexpected threat vectors. In addition, good system hygiene has to be practiced; systems need to be maintained and upgraded in timely fashion, as well as physically protected from usurpers. Furthermore, sensible policies have to guarantee only appropriate users have potentially dangerous privileges, and only those which are absolutely needed.

## 42.3 Learning Objectives:
- Assess system security risks.
- Fashion and implement sound computer security policies and procedures.
- Efficiently protect BIOS and the boot loader with passwords.
- Use appropriate **mount** options, **setuid** and **setgid** to enhance security.

## 42.4 Local System Security
Computers are inherently insecure and need protection from people who would intrude in on or attack them. This can be done to simply harm the system, deny services, or steal information.

No computer can ever be absolutely secure. All we can do is slow down and/or discourage intruders so that they either go away and hunt for easier targets, or so we can catch them in the act and take appropriate action.

Security can be defined in terms of the system's ability to regularly do what it is supposed to do, integrity and correctness of the system, and ensuring that the system is only available to those authorized to use it.

The biggest problem with security is to find that appropriate mix of security and productivity; if security restrictions are tight, opaque, and difficult, especially with ineffective measures, users will circumvent procedures.

The four areas we need to protect include physical, local, remote, and personnel. In this section, we will not concentrate on network security, we will concentrate on local factors.
