# Chapter 43 Basic Troubleshooting - Notes

## 43.3 Learning Objectives:
- Troubleshoot your system, following a number of steps iteratively until solutions are found.
- Check your network and file integrity for possible issues.
- Resolve problems when there is system boot failure.
- Repair and recover corrupted filesystems.
- Understand how **rescue and recovery** media can be used for troubleshooting.

## 43.4 Troubleshooting Levels
There are three levels of troubleshooting:
1. **Beginner**: Can be taught very quickly.
2. **Experienced**: Comes after a few years of practice.
3. **Wizard**: Some people think you have to be born this way, but that is nonsense; all skills can be learned. Every organization should have at least one person at this level of expertise to use as the go-to person.

Even the best administered systems will develop problems. Troubleshooting can isolate whether the problems arise from software or hardware, as well as whether they are local to the system, or come from within the local network or the Internet.

Troubleshooting properly requires judgment and experience, and while it will always be somewhat of an art form, following good methodical procedures can really help isolate the sources of problems in reproducible fashion.
