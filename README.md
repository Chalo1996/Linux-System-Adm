# Linux Foundation LFS201 / Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator Exam Prep Course

This repo contains all of the downloaded PDFs, some code, and my Markdown notes taken during the self-paced online LFS201 course hosted by the Linux Foundation. I hope to take the certification exam in early 2019.

Disclaimer: Most emphasis (whether *italics* or **bold** type) used in these documents are from the course materials, but some have been added by me. All screenshots are from course materials. I do not own the images.
